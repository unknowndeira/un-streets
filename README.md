# un-streets 
* I just wanted to make streets more realistic and made this script. 
* There are several polyzones in the map and when you enter them, the script itself creates some vehicles in the polyzone.

# Dependencies
* [polyzone](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/PolyZone)

> if you need some help or you want to have some unique scripts > deira#0010
